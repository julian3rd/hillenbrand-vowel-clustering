The vowels are separated into different clusters using k-means clustering and Gaussian mixture models. Clustering is implemented in `scikit-learn` and visualization is performed in R using `ggplot2`. Formants and formant ratios are used as the features for the clustering.  \r\n\r\n# Steps:  \r\n1. Import data and remove rows with at least one missing observation  \r\n2. Identify observation by word, vowel, and sex of speaker  \r\n3. Map vowel characteristics to observation (e.g., front, open-mid, etc.)  \r\n4. Create targets for speaker sex, word, and vowel (for supervised learning)  \r\n5. Normalizing features (z-score)  \r\n6. Create feature matrices  \r\n7. Implement clustering algorithms  \r\n8.
