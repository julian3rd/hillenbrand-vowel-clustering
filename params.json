{"name":"Vowel clustering using Hillenbrand et al. 1995 data","tagline":"Vowel ID prediction and clustering using Hillenbrand et al. 1995 data","body":"# Clustering of the Hillenbrand vowel data\r\n\r\nThis repo contains Jupyter/IPython notebooks and Python and R scripts using the data from [Hillenbrand *et al.* 1995](http://homepages.wmich.edu/~hillenbr/voweldata.html) on the acoustic measurements on American English vowels. The vowels are either identified using a Support Vector Machine or separated into different clusters using k-means clustering and Gaussian mixture models. Learning algorithms are implemented in `scikit-learn` and visualization is performed in R using `ggplot2` (clusters only). For the supervised learning, formant values are used as predictors; for the cluster analyses, formants and formant ratios are used as the features for the clustering.  \r\n\r\n# Steps:  \r\n1. Import data and remove rows with at least one missing observation  \r\n2. Identify observation by word, vowel, and sex of speaker  \r\n3. Map vowel characteristics to observation (e.g., front, open-mid, etc.)  \r\n4. Create targets for speaker sex, word, and vowel (for supervised learning)  \r\n5. Normalizing features (z-score)  \r\n6. Create feature matrices  \r\n7. Implement classification or clustering algorithms  \r\n8.
